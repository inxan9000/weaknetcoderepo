Simple Pastebin clone coded in PHP. Created for sharing code and later for penetration testing purposes (as a victim server). **THIS CODE PURPOSEFULLY HAS VULNERABILITIES AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS**

This was a personal project that I started while in PHP/MySQL calss at Duquesne University. Once I realized the impact it would have on a Computer Security Lab, I intengrated it right into the WeakNet Linux Live ISO's.

This is a FaceBook/MySpace Clone coded in PHP and MySQL which can be booted and instantly started using a liveCD in a lab. Once compromised, it could be rebooted and back to square one!

To start it, download the WeakNet Linux Live CD (WEAKERTHAN) and click the WeakNet Labs logo in the dock. This will start the web/mysql server and then firefox. Then, simply click through the bookmarks I included in the disk to get to the user interface.

Or, you could download the CODE here as a zip file.
